```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```


First we need to load the data:

```{r}
library(readxl)
food <- read_excel("~/Other/devweek_pres/ABBREV.xlsx")
summary(food)
```

Lets take a look at low-fat, high-protein, high-energy foods. The nutrient data is provided per 100g. I may want to convert to portion at the end. In the documentation it describes how to do this:

$ y = \frac{x * GmWt_1}{100}$

where `y` = value scaled by proportion, x = normalized valuer (per 100g), and `GmWt_1` is a column of the database.

To do this, lets first select the columns we care about and the columns for scaling.

```{r}
food_sample <- food %>% 
    select(Shrt_Desc, Energ_Kcal, `Protein_(g)`, `Lipid_Tot_(g)`, GmWt_1, GmWt_Desc1)

summary(food_sample)
pairsD3::pairsD3(food_sample)
```




```{r}
ggplot(food, aes(x = Protein_(g), y = Energ_Kcal))
```
